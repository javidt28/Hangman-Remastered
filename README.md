# Hangman Remastered
 This is a version of the paperbased game hangman. The objective is to solve the word puzzle by letters one at a time. Each time you solve a word puzzle ten (10) points will be added to your score. You will have only eight (8) attempts of guessing the wrong letter before the game terminates and the man is hung. Each time the game is ran a new word or phrase will be generated.
The image below is what you'll see after eight (8) wrong guesses.
